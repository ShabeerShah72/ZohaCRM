⚙️ Deployment Steps

Create custom fields in Deals:

Next_Followup_Date
Deal_Score
Stalled
Escalation_Level
Create a custom module Deal_Audit with logging fields.
Upload Deluge functions into Zoho CRM → Functions.
Configure workflow rules for deal stage changes.
Set up scheduled jobs for deal reconciliation.
Import email templates for notifications.
Add Slack/Teams webhook URLs or external endpoints in config.

✅ Testing Scenarios

Deal → Sales Qualified → Follow-up task + notification created.
Deal stuck at Proposal Sent (past threshold) → Escalation + manager email triggered.
Inactive deal → Flagged as Stalled with score update.
Manual re-check → Automation re-runs and logs event in Deal_Audit.

🔐 Security

All API/webhook calls signed with HMAC-SHA256.
Secrets securely stored in Zoho Vault/config module.
Built-in retry logic for failed webhooks.
